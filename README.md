* Description:
 The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and similarity between movies. The system analyzes movie data such as genres, keywords, and ratings to recommend the most relevant movies.
* Technologies Used:
 Python, PyCharm, Pandas(for data processing), NumPy (for numerical operations), Scikit-learn (for similarity calculation), Cosine Similarity Algorithm(recommendation algo), Jupyter Notebook
* Outcome:
 This project recommends movies to users based on their selection. When a user selects a movie, the system uses cosine similarity to find and display five similar movies. I built the interface using Streamlit and implemented the recommendation logic using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
